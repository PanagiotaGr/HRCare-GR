# HRCare-GR

**Hybrid LLM Architecture for Assistive Human-Robot Collaboration in Greek Elderly Care**

HRCare-GR is a research-oriented Python MVP inspired by hybrid LLM architectures for human-robot collaboration, but implemented as an original project with a Greek elderly-care scenario, modular graph workflow, deterministic care rules, and simulation-first design.

## What it does

The system simulates an assistive robot that supports an older adult during a daily care routine. It combines:

- patient profile retrieval,
- task generation,
- deterministic scheduling rules,
- situation assessment,
- robot response generation,
- progress checking,
- structured session logging.

The first version runs fully from the command line and can work without an API key by using a deterministic mock LLM.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python -m app.main
```

## Example patient IDs

- `P001`: Maria Papadopoulou
- `P002`: Nikos Antoniou

## Research angle

Possible university title:

> A Hybrid LLM and Rule-Based Architecture for Personalized Human-Robot Collaboration in Elderly Care Environments

Possible evaluation metrics:

- task completion rate,
- schedule conflict rate,
- response appropriateness,
- patient-state consistency,
- number of safety rule violations,
- average interaction turns per activity.

## Safety note

This is a simulation and research prototype. It must not be used for real medical decision-making.
